You are an expert Discord bot developer. I want you to build a **fully automated all-in-one Discord bot** for an NSFW community server themed around **Indian exhibitionism, seller-voyeur interaction, sugar babies, sugar daddies, and couple content**. 

This bot should manage **everything in the server**, with deep automation and full modularity. Here's the detailed breakdown of features and expectations:

---

🧠 **Core Bot Framework**:
- Use **discord.py** with **cogs/modular command structure**.
- Store user data and role permissions in **JSON or MongoDB**.
- Create command, event, and utility folders.

---

🔐 **Verification System**:
- !verify [seller | sugarbaby | couple] — triggers a DM-based flow.
- DM user to upload ID + paper verification (write name + date on paper).
- Store file link + userID in a verification queue channel.
- Optional: Write function `analyze_verification_image()` (use AI in future to auto-check if name/date present).
- Admins manually approve or reject via `!approve @user` or `!reject @user`.

---

🎭 **Role & Access Automation**:
- Auto-assign verified roles after approval.
- Assign roles like `@Voyeur`, `@Seller`, `@SugarBaby`, `@Couple`, `@VIP`, `@NSFW Lover` via reaction role panel.
- Create `!panel setup` command that posts a message with reaction emojis and adds/removes roles accordingly.

---

📸 **Content Posting Bot**:
- Allow verified sellers to post in specific `#seller-content`, `#couples-zone`, etc.
- Use cooldowns (1 post per hour) to prevent spam.
- Auto-tag their post with their role + username.
- Auto-delete messages with Telegram handles unless verified.

---

🛍️ **Selling System**:
- `!sell [caption]` — bot auto-generates a post embed with caption, user tag, price info.
- Optional: Link payment methods (manual or link-based).
- Show buyer instructions in DM.
- Future support for Gumroad or Ko-fi integration.

---

🆘 **Moderation & Auto-Moderation**:
- !ban, !kick, !mute, !purge, !warn, !infractions
- Anti-spam, anti-link filter (for unverified users).
- AI/keyword-based NSFW content scanner (placeholder logic).
- Auto log bans/mutes to #mod-logs.

---

💬 **AI Assistant (NSFW-themed)**:
- Create simple AI chat mode (`!chat`) where users can DM bot for NSFW questions.
- Use OpenAI or GPT-like API (placeholder function).
- Keep conversations stored per user in simple JSON.

---

📈 **Analytics & Tracking**:
- Track total members, verified users, active sellers, top content posters.
- `!stats` command to show weekly/monthly breakdown.
- Auto DM sellers with tips if inactive for 7+ days.

---

🎟️ **Ticket System**:
- `!support` — opens private mod ticket channel.
- `!close` to close tickets.
- Optional emoji-button based ticket panel.

---

🎉 **Engagement Features**:
- `!daily` — random rewards (XP, roles, exposure points).
- Leaderboard of top posters/sellers.
- Auto welcome messages with onboarding guide.

---

🧰 **Admin/Owner Utilities**:
- `!setrules`, `!setfaq`, `!broadcast`, `!massdm`, `!shutdown`
- Owner-only commands for emergency lockdown, announcements.
- Easy config via `config.json`.

---

💾 **Hosting & Deployment**:
- Must be able to run on **Replit**, **24/7**, with minimal external dependencies.
- Use `keep_alive.py` and UptimeRobot if needed.
- Token hidden via `.env` and `secrets`.

---

🧪 **Advanced/Optional Features (Mark as TODO)**:
- AI verification of handwritten paper name+date.
- Content filter for revenge porn or stolen content (flagging system).
- NSFW Chatbot channel for community use.
- Partner server promotion with cooldown.
- Payment verification (via Razorpay, etc.).

---

Your goal is to **code the entire base bot** with placeholders and ready-to-extend features. Structure the project cleanly. Comment each section in code with `# TODO` for missing AI components. Make it modular, secure, and scalable for a growing NSFW server.

---

DO NOT add anything unrelated like music commands, memes, or games. Keep everything tightly focused on managing an **exclusive NSFW content-based community**.

Now begin building the bot.
